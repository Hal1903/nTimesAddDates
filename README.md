# nTimesAddDates
VBA project developed after taking internship.

# All the works I created before my primary job became giving macro sessions are in FromHaruku.bas

# The motivation of this project is being assigned to pipe sorting, which is repetitive and boring. On the second day, I asked my boss to consider assigning me to data process on Excel. I decided to learn macros and intensely and studied in a factory while sorting and eating and at home.
# I spent 1 day to master the task manually. Then I started working on automation. Those works are created within a month.
